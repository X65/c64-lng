Compiling the applications:

 a simple make should do it.

To compile some applications by hand do...

 export LUPO_INCLUDEPATH=../kernel
 luna -R -o lsmod lsmod.s

If you plan to write your own application(s), you might want 
to use "sceleton.s" as a template to start from. 

Starting with LNG version 0.17 there are also some library functions that
might help you to finish your application - in that case take a look
at "amalloc.s" on how to write applications that use library functions.
