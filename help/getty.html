usage: getty baudrate<p><p>
Lets you connect a serial terminal to you LNG system and use the system 
like sitting directly at the console. All keys pressed at the terminal
are passed to the shell, results are sent back to the terminal.
getty relies on the slightly obsolete SERv1 API and will be replace by a
newer program soon. (interoperates with "sswiftlink", "srs232std")
