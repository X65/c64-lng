Usage: buf<p><p>
Buf is a quite simple application. Buf reads from 
standard input and tries to keep everything in memory until a EOF 
(end of file). After receiving an EOF buf prints all data from
memory to standard output. <p><p>
I used buf to receive text pasted into an LNG window when running a remote
session (telnet from my PC to LNG), because it showed up that pasting directly
into an LNG file (using "tee") degraded TCP/IP performance a lot. I suggest to 
use "buf!tee" instead. <p><p>
An other example: "cat file1!buf!tee file2" is usually faster 
than "cp file1 file2" but doesn't work for huge files.
