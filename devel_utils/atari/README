These are utilities useful for building LUnix kernel and transferring it to
Atari.
After you have boot.atari and kernel.atari copy them to a temporary subdirectory,
copy there also makeimage (built from makeimage.c :) and run it there. You will
have atari.bin which is file ready to be loaded by Atari DOS. Unfortunately I
don't know how to move it to a bootable disk, so you must load it from DOS.

Some tools from Internet that I have gathered here:

femul-1.4.c	- every Atari poweruser knows what's that for :) (find in source
		  code the port ttyS[0-4] and change it to correct one before
		  compiling)

unix2atr-0.9.c	- I use it to move atari.bin to a disk image so I can load it
		  on Real Machine (tm) from DOS

binload		- Atari binary format analyzer
