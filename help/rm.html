Usage: rm file... <p><p>
Remove files. Wildcards are not supported explicitely - wildcards have 
to be expanded by the shell anyway :)<p><p> 
In spite of that, be careful with special chars like "*" "," "?" "@" 
since these might be interpreted by the CBM bios (rm issues a 
open x,dev,15,"s:file" command)
