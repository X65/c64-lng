my to-do list:
-- environment for a working "more" command (partly done)
-- driver for UP9600 (enhanced userport rs232 interface)
-- driver for 16550 based RS232 interfaces
-- RAM disc for REU
-- general support for external RAM
-- environment for "ps" with command names
-- better vt100/ansi emulation
-- better handling of lines longer than 40 chars
-- shell command completion (from history buffer ?)
-- shell wildcard expansion
-- command cache
-- move parts of the kernel into a library
-- distribute lunix in a >compressed< archive
-- execute shell scripts like binaries
