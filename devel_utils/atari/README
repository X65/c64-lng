These are utilities useful for building LUnix kernel and transferring it to
Atari.
After you have boot.atari and kernel.atari copy them to a temporary subdirectory,
copy there also makeimage (built from makeimage.c :) and run it there. You will
have atari.bin which is file ready to be loaded by Atari DOS. Unfortunately I
don't know how to move it to a bootable disk, so you must load it from DOS.

Use make.sh script to build lngboot.atr disk image for use under emulator.
It should work pretty smart. Or you can use DOS and copy atari.bin to disk
image chaos.atr. It should allow for easy loading upon boot.

Some tools from Internet that I have gathered here:

femul-1.4.c	- every Atari poweruser knows what's that for :) (find in source
		  code the port ttyS[0-4] and change it to correct one before
		  compiling)

unix2atr-0.9.c	- I use it to move atari.bin to a disk image so I can load it
		  on Real Machine (tm) from DOS

binload		- Atari binary format analyzer

atr2unix-1.2.c	- for getting files out of .atr

chaos.atr	- Chaos boot loader, copy file there and should be able to
		  load it on boot

dos25/		- DOS.SYS, DUP.SYS
mydos/		- DOS.SYS, DUP.SYS (actually, working)
