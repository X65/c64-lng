usage: uuencode [-m] remotefile<p><p>
Uuencode and uudecode are used to transmit binary files
over transmission mediums that do not support other than
simple ASCII data.<p>
Uuencode reads the standard input and
writes an encoded version to the standard output. The
encoding uses only printing ASCII characters and includes
the mode of the file and the operand name for use by uude­
code. By default the standard UU encoding
format will be used. If the option -m is given on the
command line base64 encoding af of RFC1521 is used instead.<p>
Remotefile is the name of the file, that will be created on the
destination system.<p><p>
