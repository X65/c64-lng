(to-fix-list)
- Mixed TCP/ICMP traffic sometimes causes the machine to hang

- on C128 PPP is buggy and SLIP doesn't work at all - are ppp,slip,tcpip
  free from c64-specific code? does mmu_stack matter?

- bug in atari tasksw.s - lk_timer stuff should be affected _only_ if IRQ source was timer,
  now it is decremented on both timer and keyboard interrupts
  fix is obvious but I want to test it on a real machine

- rs232std seems not to operate well with the TCP/IP code

- ftp sometimes has problems with longer file names, it seems to
  download the file but in fact doesn't save the received data to disc

- #!interpreter works only with O65 onabled
  (rewrite kernel/execute.s - there are 3 paths basing on first 2 bytes from file:
   LUNIX MAGIC, O65 MAGIC and "#!")

- check if PWD is changed with cd tool (is it?)
