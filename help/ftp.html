usage: ftp host<p><p>
Ftp implementes the file tranfer protocol used in TCP/IP networks. 
Using ftp you can download binaries or view text located on a remote
host. The host must be identified by its IP-number since DNS lookups
are not yet implemented. Ftp supports the following commands:<p>
cd - change directory<p>
pwd - view current directory<p>
type i/a - set ascii (a) or binary (i) tranfer mode<p>
dir - list files in current directory<p>
more - display remote textfile<p>
get - download remote file<p>
quit - leave ftp<p>
