232term is a very simple terminal program. Like 232echo it asks for
a baudrate at the commandline and then enters operative state. Key strokes are
sent to the serial interface, received characters are displayed on the screen.
232term can be used to log into a remote host (eg. your ISP). Press CTRL+D
to leave 232term.
