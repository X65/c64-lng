# generate jumptab.h from kfunc_tab.s
# kfunc_tab.s is just a list of all provided kernel functions
# the functions are numbered 0,2,4,6,... and are mapped to virtual
# addresses starting at lk_jumptab (currently $0200) those
# virtual addresses get remapped to the proper kernel address by
# the code relocator.
# jumptab.h is generated by processing jumptab.s line by line
#  .word  <function_name>
# becomes
#  #define <function_name> [lk_jumptab + OFFS]
# (OFFS starts with 0 and is incremented by 2 each line)
